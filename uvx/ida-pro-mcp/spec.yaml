# Security allowlist for false positives
security:
  allowed_issues:
    - code: "AITech-9.1"
      reason: "Code execution and injection patterns are expected for a reverse engineering tool that disassembles and renames functions in IDA Pro"
    - code: "AITech-12.1"
      reason: "Tool poisoning patterns are false positives - modifying function prototypes, variable types, stack frames, and reading memory/data are core reverse engineering operations in IDA Pro"
    - code: "AITech-8.2"
      reason: "Data exfiltration patterns are false positives - reading strings and binary data from IDA databases is the fundamental purpose of this reverse engineering tool"
