# Security allowlist for known false positives from YARA-based scanning
security:
  allowed_issues:
    - code: "AITech-9.1"
      reason: "False positive - YARA rule 'system_manipulation' triggers on os.getenv() calls in utils.py. These are standard Python calls for reading Neo4j configuration from environment variables (NEO4J_URL, NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD, NEO4J_DATABASE). This is legitimate configuration handling, not system manipulation."
    - code: "AITech-12.1"
      reason: "False positive - YARA rule 'script_injection' triggers on asyncio.run() in __init__.py which matches the pattern for dangerous Run() functions. asyncio.run() is the standard Python function for running async code and poses no injection risk."
