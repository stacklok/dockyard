    - code: "TF001"
      reason: |
        Data leak toxic flow is expected for a Notion integration server. Notion MCP server:
        - Reads private Notion workspace data including pages, databases, and user information (private data access)
        - Processes user-generated content from various Notion sources and external integrations (untrusted content)
        - Exports and shares Notion data through search, fetch, and analysis operations (public sink)
        This combination is essential for the Notion MCP server to function effectively,
        allowing agents to access, analyze, and work with Notion workspace content and data.
    - code: "TF002"
      reason: |
        Destructive toxic flow is expected and required for Notion content management. The server includes:
        - Tools to delete, update, and move Notion pages, databases, and other content (destructive operations)
        - Tools that process user-generated content from Notion workspaces and external sources (untrusted content)
        These capabilities are essential for proper Notion workspace management,
        allowing agents to create, modify, organize, and maintain Notion content effectively.
