    - code: "TF001"
      reason: |
        Data leak toxic flow is expected for an observability platform. Phoenix MCP server:
        - Reads traces, spans, and evaluation data (private data access)
        - Processes and analyzes observability data from various sources (untrusted content)
        - Exports and shares data for analysis (public sink)
        This combination is essential for the observability platform to function,
        allowing agents to monitor, analyze, and report on application performance and LLM traces.
    - code: "TF002"
      reason: |
        Destructive toxic flow is expected and required for data management. The server includes:
        - Tools to delete traces, spans, and evaluations (destructive operations)
        - Tools that process data from external sources (untrusted content)
        These capabilities are essential for proper data lifecycle management,
        allowing agents to clean up old data and manage the observability platform effectively.
