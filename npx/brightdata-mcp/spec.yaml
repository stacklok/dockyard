    - code: "AITech-12.1"
      reason: |
        LLM analyzer flags scrape_as_markdown and scrape_batch tools with AITech-12.1
        (Tool Poisoning) because their descriptions state they "can unlock any webpage
        even if it uses bot detection or CAPTCHA." This is NOT tool poisoning - it's
        the legitimate core functionality of Bright Data's commercial web scraping
        service. The tools:
        - Call the official Bright Data API (api.brightdata.com)
        - Are read-only (readOnlyHint: true) with no destructive capabilities
        - Transparently document their CAPTCHA/bot-detection bypass capability
        - Use authenticated API tokens for access control
        YARA analysis finds no threats. The "unlock" feature is the product's value
        proposition, not malicious behavior. Verified in v2.8.0.
