security:
  allowed_issues:
    - code: "AITech-12.1"
      reason: "Tool descriptions use structured XML-like documentation (e.g., <use_case>, <important_notes>) to provide AI assistants with workflow guidance. This is legitimate documentation pattern for MCP tools, not tool poisoning."
    - code: "AITech-1.1"
      reason: "Tool descriptions contain SQL examples and structured workflow instructions with MUST directives for database migration and query tuning tools. These are legitimate documentation patterns, not prompt injection attacks."
    - code: "AITech-9.1"
      reason: "SQL examples in prepare_database_migration tool description (e.g., ALTER TABLE, SELECT) are documentation showing usage patterns, not SQL injection payloads."
    - code: "AITech-8.2"
      reason: "The provision_neon_auth tool legitimately provisions authentication credentials and explains how to use them. References to credential names in documentation are necessary for proper tool usage, not credential harvesting."
